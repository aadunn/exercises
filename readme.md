# coding exercises -- and the way dunn solves them

Some programming exercises and my thought process of how I'd solve them. Repo for tutoring purposes.

Note: i'm using javascript here but i can switch to python if you'd rather

for reference:
```
// arrays
someArray[0] = 'a';        // assigns the value 'a' to the first element in the array
someArray[4];              // return the value found at position 4 in someArray. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
	                                                                                  //  ^4th position
```
